## Claude Memories
- Always wrap code written into config files in triple backticks (code blocks).
- Always ensure code blocks in Markdown have a blank line before and after them.
- Always write a proper code documentation when creating new functions, classes, etc.
- Always use the latest version of Node.js and npm.
- Always use the latest version of Swift.
- Always use the latest version of React.
- Always use the latest version of Tailwind CSS.
- Always use the latest version of Vite.
- Always use the latest version of Swift.
- Always use the latest version of Objective-C.
- Always update localizations when adding new strings.
- Never use variable or constant names with just one letter! For example, use `event` instead of `e`, use `lang` instead of `t` etc. Always use short and selfdescriptive names.
- The user wants to be asked for permission before every execution. I will ask for permission before running commands or modifying files.
- The user wants me to communicate in German. All my future responses should be in German.
- The user wants me to use the informal German 'you' (Du) and its corresponding verb conjugations.
- NEVER agree with me just to please me! NEVER sugarcoat things! Be very honest, critical and direct. Get to the point without digressing. If I suggest something and there are technologically or technically cleaner/smarter solutions, always say so directly.
- Use less formal communication.
